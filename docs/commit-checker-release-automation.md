# Dataproc Teleport Github repo - Release Automation


# How should the commits be written using Conventional Commits standards?

The commit message should be structured as follows:


---


```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```


The most important prefixes types you should have in mind are:



* **fix**: which represents bug fixes, and correlates to a SemVer patch.
* **feat**: which represents a new feature, and correlates to a SemVer minor.
* **feat!:** which represents a breaking change (indicated by the **!**) and will result in a SemVer major.
* types other than fix: and feat: are also allowed viz. **build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, refactor:, perf:, test:**


# Example Commit Messages



1. [Using **fix:**] Commit message for a patch

    ```
    fix: Enabled csv support for GCStoGCS template
    ```


2. [Using **feat:**] Commit message to enable a new feature

    ```
    feat: Built Python GCStoGCS template for Dataproc
    ```


3. [Using **feat!:**]Commit message with `!` to draw attention to breaking change

    ```
    feat!: Java & Python Dataproc templates released for customer usage now
    ```


4. Commit message for a build or regular chore jobs

    ```
     chore: Updated a link on the README file
     build: Completed build for GCStoGCS template
     refactor: Updated variable name for GCStoGCS template
    ```


5. Commit message for integration testing, performance enhancement or automation

    ```
     test: Integration testing completed for GCStoGCS template
    ```



    ```
     perf: Validated GCStoGCS template with 100GB load` 

    ```

    ```
     ci: Implemented the Jenkins automation for GCStoGCS template 
    ```


6. Commit message for publishing/documentation

    ```
     docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG
    ```


7. Commit message with multi-paragraph body and multiple footers

    ```
    fix: prevent racing of requests

    Introduce a request id and a reference to latest request. Dismiss
    incoming responses other than from latest request.

    Remove timeouts which were used to mitigate the racing issue but are
    obsolete now.

    ```



# What is the Commit-checker bot?

Everytime a PR is created, the Commit-checker bot validates whether the commit message syntax contains the allowed prefix or not. Below image shows the example for a Commit check failed and two Commit checks passed.

Ideally, a PR should not be merged until all the checks are passed


# What to do if Commit-checker check fails?

A Commit-checker bot check fails when the above stated conventional commit standards are not followed while pushing a PR. A detailed error would read something like below:

To fix the error, one can push a commit again with a valid prefix added to the commit message. Once, The same PR gets updated with a valid commit message, the Commit-checker bot gets triggered automatically and will successfully pass the consequent checks.


# Why should conventional commit standards be followed?

Conventional commits help with the ease of readability and understanding of the Git history. With a growing github repo like dataproc-templates, generating the change logs with every new release becomes important.

By using conventional commits, we can now generate the Change Log automatically at each release using a release-please bot. The bot will look at the commits published and the basis of the type prefix mentioned in the commits - it will be able to segregate the features, patches and documentation created in a new release.


# release-please bot

Release Please assumes you are using Conventional Commit messages. Release Please automates CHANGELOG generation, the creation of GitHub releases, and version bumps for your projects.

It does so by parsing your git history, looking for [Conventional Commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), and creating release PRs.


# What's a Release PR?

Rather than continuously releasing what's landed to your default branch, release-please maintains Release PRs:

![alt_text](https://github.com/ankuljain09/test_repo/blob/main/docs/4ZcDE4arcyEXmvY.png)


These Release PRs are kept up-to-date as additional work is merged. When you're ready to tag a release, simply merge the release PR. Both squash-merge and merge commits work with Release PRs.

When the Release PR is merged, release-please takes the following steps:



1. Updates your changelog file (for example CHANGELOG.md)
2. Creates a GitHub Release based on the tag with the version number
